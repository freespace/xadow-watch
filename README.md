# Run time
Run time is currently approximately 8 hours. This depends however on using my modified versions of the Seeedstudio libraries:

* [`Xadow_mainboard`](https://github.com/freespace/Xadow_MainBoard)
* [`RGB_OLED_SSD1331`](https://github.com/freespace/RGB_OLED_SSD1331)
* [`SGL`](https://github.com/freespace/SGL)

Additionally to compile this project in Arduino 1.6.x you will need to install the `seeeduino` vendor files in the `v1.6.3` directory in [Files_For_Seeed_Main_Board](https://github.com/freespace/Files_For_Seeed_Main_Board).
